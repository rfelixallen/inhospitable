-Working on new ways to define buildings and draw them to the map. Right now, it seems like I need to make a class that defines my structures, and then initialize the class once in main.rb. Then, I can call any structure I want.
-Opted to stick with one type of bunker that actually draws. The next challenge is determining randomly if they are inhabited.
