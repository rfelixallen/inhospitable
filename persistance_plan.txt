persistance plan

Would like the player to be able to save and load game files. I would like to achieve the following:

* Ability to save game from Menu once its been started.
* Ability to load from save files

Other considerations
* Would need to Load the Main menu first, and then initialize the game. If the game hasnt been initialized, there will be no option to save.
* I'll need to export all tiles of the map to a file. If I can use a seed to generate the game, then all I need to do is save the seed and regenerate the map based off that.

Initializing the game can either generate values and assign them to the game, or load the values from a file and use those. I need to identify what the game is initializing, and save that.
